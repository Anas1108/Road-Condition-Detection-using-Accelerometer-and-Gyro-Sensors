# Road-Condition-Detection-using-Accelerometer-and-Gyro-Sensors
A study on road conditions using accelerometer &amp; gyro sensors. Investigate if combining accelerometer &amp; gyro readings improves road condition detection. Examine which accelerometer readings better explain road conditions. Verify if high speeds lead to mostly bad road conditions
